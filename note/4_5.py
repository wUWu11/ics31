Programming language help model the real-world slove complete problems

-Single-value data
    -int float, boolean
boolean
    -Boolean values are a special type that evaluates to either True or False
- Multi-valued data
    -lists["a","b",'c']
    -Namedtuples(Students)

-Functions
    -"Routines" that perform some computation given 0 or more input paramates,
    which may or may not return to a value
    -Examples:
        -print(some values)
        -input()
        -str(5)
- Methods
    -Similiar to functions, but are used with some value.

#indexing
'''
indexing allows us to extract a specific element in a list
In computer science, we usually start counting at 0
Therefore, the list element of a list is at index 0, the 2nd element is at 1,
the last element is at index n -1, where n is the number of element in the list
